# How to use
This project is based around the "cobi" binary, which can be built from scratch using Cargo / Rust.
Instructions for installing Cargo are here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html

Once cargo is installed, the binary can be build by running `cargo build --release`, which places it in target/release/cobi

Alternatively, it can be run by running `cargo run`
